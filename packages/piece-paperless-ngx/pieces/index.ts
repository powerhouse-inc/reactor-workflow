// The pieces this reactor package ships.

// One entry per piece: what it is called, what version this package installs,
// and where its built module sits relative to the package root — the path the
// node build emits it to. Everything else — display name, description,
// actions, triggers, auth — is read from the piece itself, so this list cannot
// drift from the code.
