// The Powerhouse reactor piece: documents and document models as workflow
// blocks, for the reactor the workflow itself runs in.

// It reaches the reactor through ctx.reactor, which the host serves over the
// worker's call channel — piece code never holds a reactor client, and a copy
// of this piece fetched from a registry would find the member throwing.
